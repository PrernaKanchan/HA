# Home Automation Using Raspberry Pi
This project involves working with Raspberry Pi to control appliances through an Android application and synchronizing the real-time data in Firebase database.

This system uses cloud services to sync user data into Firebase database. 

The androidapplication on Firebase will still be maintained even if there is an interruption in internet connection. 

It is inexpensive, secure and easy to implement and uses open sources technologies.
